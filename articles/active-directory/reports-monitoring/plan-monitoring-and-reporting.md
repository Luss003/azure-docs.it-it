# <a name="plan-an-azure-active-directory-reporting-and-monitoring-deployment"></a>Plan an Azure Active Directory reporting and monitoring deployment

Your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) reporting and monitoring solution depends on your legal, security, and operational requirements and your existing environment and processes. This article presents the various design options and guides you to the right deployment strategy.

### <a name="benefits-of-azure-ad-reporting-and-monitoring"></a>Benefits of Azure AD reporting and monitoring

Azure AD reporting provides a comprehensive view and logs of Azure AD activity in your environment, including sign in events, audit events, and changes to your directory.

I dati forniti consentono di:

* determine how your apps and services are used.

* detect potential risks affecting the health of your environment.

* troubleshoot issues preventing your users from getting their work done.

* gain insights by seeing audit events of changes to your Azure AD directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure AD monitoring enables you to route your logs generated by Azure AD reporting to different target systems. dove sarà poi possibile conservarli per l'uso a lungo termine o integrarli con strumenti per informazioni di sicurezza e gestione degli eventi di terze parti per ottenere informazioni dettagliate sull'ambiente.

With Azure AD monitoring, you can route logs to:

* an Azure storage account for archival purposes.
* Azure Monitor logs, formerly known as Azure Log Analytics workspace, where you can analyze the data, create dashboards, and alert on specific events.
* an Azure event hub where you can integrate with your existing SIEM tools such as Splunk, Sumologic, or QRadar.

> [!NOTE]
We recently started using the term Azure Monitor logs instead of Log Analytics. I dati di log vengono comunque archiviati in un'area di lavoro Log Analytics e vengano ancora raccolti e analizzati dallo stesso servizio Log Analytics. Si sta procedendo a un aggiornamento della terminologia per riflettere meglio il ruolo dei [log in Monitoraggio di Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-collection). Per informazioni dettagliate, vedere [Modifiche della terminologia di Monitoraggio di Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/azure-monitor-rebrand).

[Learn more about report retention policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-reports-data-retention).

### <a name="licensing-and-prerequisites-for-azure-ad-reporting-and-monitoring"></a>Licensing and prerequisites for Azure AD reporting and monitoring

You'll need an Azure AD premium license to access the Azure AD sign in logs.

For detailed feature and licensing information in the [Azure Active Directory pricing guide](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).

To deploy Azure AD monitoring and reporting you'll need a user who is a global administrator or security administrator for the Azure AD tenant.

Depending on the final destination of your log data, you'll need one of the following:

* An Azure storage account that you have ListKeys permissions for. È consigliabile usare un account di archiviazione generale invece di un account di archiviazione BLOB. Per informazioni sui prezzi per l'archiviazione, vedere il [calcolatore prezzi di Archiviazione di Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=storage).

* An Azure Event Hubs namespace to integrate with third-party SIEM solutions.

* Un'area di lavoro Azure Log Analytics per inviare log a log di Monitoraggio di Azure.

## <a name="plan-an-azure-reporting-and-monitoring-deployment-project"></a>Plan an Azure reporting and monitoring deployment project

In this project, you'll define the audiences that will consume and monitor reports, and define your Azure AD monitoring architecture.

### <a name="engage-the-right-stakeholders"></a>Engage the right stakeholders

When technology projects fail, they typically do so due to mismatched expectations on impact, outcomes, and responsibilities. To avoid these pitfalls, [ensure that you're engaging the right stakeholders](https://aka.ms/deploymentplans). Also ensure that stakeholder roles in the project are well understood by documenting the stakeholders and their project input and accountabilities.

### <a name="plan-communications"></a>Pianificare le comunicazioni

Communication is critical to the success of any new service. Proactively communicate with your users how their experience will change, when it will change, and how to gain support if they experience issues.

### <a name="document-your-current-infrastructure-and-policies"></a>Document your current infrastructure and policies

Your current infrastructure and policies will drive your reporting and monitoring design. Ensure that you know

* What, if any, SIEM tools you're using.

* Your Azure infrastructure, including existing storage accounts and monitoring being used.

* Your organizational retention policies for logs, including any applicable compliance frameworks required. 

## <a name="plan-an-azure-ad-reporting-and-monitoring-deployment"></a>Plan an Azure AD reporting and monitoring deployment

Reporting and monitoring are used to meet your business requirements, gain insights into usage patterns, and t increase your organizations security posture.

### <a name="business-use-cases"></a>Business use cases

* Required for solution to meet business needs
* Nice to have to meet business needs
* Non applicabile

|Area |Description |
|-|-|
|Conservazione| **Log retention of more than 30 days**. ‎Due to legal or business requirements it is required to store audit logs and sign in logs of Azure AD longer than 30 days. |
|Analytics| **The logs need to be searchable**. ‎The stored logs need to be searchable with analytic tools. |
| Operational Insights| **Insights for various teams**. The need to give access for different users to gain operational insights such as application usage, sign in errors, self-service usage, trends, etc. |
| Security Insights| **Insights for various teams**. The need to give access for different users to gain operational insights such as application usage, sign in errors, self service usage, trends, etc. |
| Integration in SIEM systems      | **SIEM integration**. ‎The need to integrate and stream Azure AD sign in logs and audit logs to existing SIEM systems. |

### <a name="choose-a-monitoring-solution-architecture"></a>Choose a monitoring solution architecture

With Azure AD monitoring, you can route your Azure AD activity logs to a system that best meets your business needs. You can then retain them for long-term reporting and analysis to gain insights into your environment, and integrate it with SIEM tools.

#### <a name="archive-logs-in-a-storage-account"></a>Archive logs in a storage account

By routing logs to an Azure storage account, you can keep them for longer than the default retention period outlined in our [retention policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-reports-data-retention). Use this method if you need to archive your logs, but don't need to integrate them with an SIEM system, and don't need ongoing queries and analysis. You can still do on-demand searches.

Informazioni su come [indirizzare i dati all'account di archiviazione](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-azure-monitor-route-logs-to-storage-account).

#### <a name="send-logs-to-azure-monitor-logs"></a>Inviare log ai log di Monitoraggio di Azure

[Azure Monitor logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-overview) consolidate monitoring data from different sources. It also provides a query language and analytics engine that gives you insights into the operation of your applications and use of resources. By sending Azure AD activity logs to Azure Monitor logs, you can quickly retrieve, monitor, and alert on collected data. Use this method when you don't have an existing SIEM solution that you want to send your data to directly but do want queries and analysis. Once your data is in Azure Monitor logs, you can then send it to event hub and from there to a SIEM if you want to.

Vedere come [inviare dati ai log di Monitoraggio di Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-log-analytics).

You can also install the pre-built views for Azure AD activity logs to monitor common scenarios involving sign in and audit events.

Vedere come [installare e usare le viste di analisi dei log per i log attività di Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-install-use-log-analytics-views).

#### <a name="stream-logs-to-your-azure-event-hub"></a>Stream logs to your Azure event hub

Routing logs to an Azure event hub enables integration with third-party SIEM tools. Questa integrazione consente di combinare i dati di log attività di Azure AD con altri dati gestiti dallo strumento per informazioni di sicurezza e gestione degli eventi, per fornire informazioni dettagliate più estese per il proprio ambiente. 

Informazioni su come [trasmettere i log a un hub eventi](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/tutorial-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub).

## <a name="plan-operations-and-security-for-azure-ad-reporting-and-monitoring"></a>Plan Operations and Security for Azure AD reporting and monitoring

Stakeholders need to access Azure AD logs to gain operational insights. Likely users include security team members, internal or external auditors, and the identity and access management operations team.

Azure AD roles enable you to delegate the ability to configure and view Azure AD Reports based on your role. Identify who in your organization needs permission to read Azure AD reports and what role would be appropriate for them. 

The following roles can read Azure AD reports:

* Amministratore globale

* Amministrazione della protezione

* Ruolo con autorizzazioni di lettura per la sicurezza

* Report Reader

Learn More About [Azure AD Administrative Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal).

*Always apply the concept of least privileges to reduce the risk of an account compromise*. Consider implementing [Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) to further secure your organization.
